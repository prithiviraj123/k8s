Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:
  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:
kubeadm join 10.160.0.6:6443 --token qcqdsu.uzaayqeytzosd3t0 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:961f9f65c60275b21d24b0e3e0125e32db46dc54108ff91896a6bc9dae608539
